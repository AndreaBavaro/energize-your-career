# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Voltify website to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Image and Video Optimization

- **OptimizedImage Component**: A custom component that handles:
  - WebP format with fallback to original formats
  - Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
  - Responsive image loading with appropriate sizing
  - Example: `<OptimizedImage src="/images/example.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />`

- **OptimizedVideo Component**: A custom component that handles:
  - Lazy loading of video content
  - Optimized playback settings
  - Responsive video display
  - Example: `<OptimizedVideo src="/videos/example.mp4" poster="/images/poster.jpg" />`

- **Background Image Optimization**:
  - WebP format with fallback
  - Responsive sizing and positioning

### 2. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

- **Component Lazy Loading**:
  - Below-the-fold components are lazy loaded using React.lazy() and Suspense
  - Implemented in `Index.tsx` for main page sections

- **Route-based Code Splitting**:
  - Each route is lazy loaded except for the landing page
  - Implemented in `App.tsx` with React.lazy() and Suspense
  - Includes a loading indicator during chunk loading

### 3. Dependency Optimization

- **Dependency Analyzer**:
  - Development utility to identify potentially unused dependencies
  - Provides recommendations for lighter alternatives
  - Runs only in development mode

### 4. Performance Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics Collection**:
  - Collects key metrics like Time to First Byte, First Paint, etc.
  - Identifies slow-loading resources
  - Logs metrics to console in production mode

- **Web Vitals Tracking**:
  - Tracks Core Web Vitals like LCP, FID, and CLS
  - Uses PerformanceObserver API for accurate measurement

### 5. Font Optimization

- **Font Preloading**:
  - Critical fonts are preloaded to prevent layout shifts
  - Variable fonts support for reduced file size
  - Font display strategies for better perceived performance

### 6. CSS Optimization

- **Unused CSS Removal**:
  - Analyzes and removes unused CSS selectors
  - Runs in production mode after page load

### 7. Server-Side Rendering Considerations

- **SSR Utilities**:
  - Environment detection (server vs. browser)
  - Data hydration helpers
  - Conditional rendering based on environment
  - SEO meta tag preparation

## Usage Guidelines

### Image Optimization

When adding new images to the site, always use the `OptimizedImage` component:

```tsx
import OptimizedImage from '../ui/OptimizedImage';

// In your component:
<OptimizedImage 
  src="/images/example.jpg" 
  alt="Description" 
  className="your-classes" 
  loading="lazy" // Use 'eager' for above-the-fold images
/>
```

### Video Optimization

For videos, use the `OptimizedVideo` component:

```tsx
import OptimizedVideo from '../ui/OptimizedVideo';

// In your component:
<OptimizedVideo 
  src="/videos/example.mp4" 
  poster="/images/poster.jpg"
  className="your-classes"
  preload="metadata" // Use 'none' for non-critical videos
/>
```

### Adding New Routes

When adding new routes, follow this pattern to ensure code splitting:

```tsx
// In App.tsx
const NewPage = lazy(() => import("./pages/NewPage"));

// In the Routes component:
<Route path="/new-page" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<PageLoading />}>
    <NewPage />
  </Suspense>
} />
```

### Adding New Components

For new sections on the main page, follow this pattern:

```tsx
// In Index.tsx
const NewSection = lazy(() => import("@/components/sections/NewSection"));

// In the render function:
<Suspense fallback={<SectionLoading />}>
  <NewSection />
</Suspense>
```

## Performance Testing

To test the performance of the site, use the following tools:

1. **Lighthouse** (in Chrome DevTools): Provides scores for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
2. **WebPageTest**: For more detailed performance metrics and filmstrip view.
3. **Chrome DevTools Performance tab**: For detailed runtime performance analysis.

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Image CDN Integration**: Consider using an image CDN for automatic optimization and responsive serving.
2. **Service Worker Caching**: Implement service workers for offline support and faster repeat visits.
3. **Preconnect to Critical Domains**: Add preconnect hints for third-party domains.
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Regularly analyze bundle size with tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer`.
5. **Full SSR Implementation**: Consider migrating to a framework with built-in SSR like Next.js for even better initial load performance.

## Maintenance

These optimizations should be maintained as the site evolves:

1. Always use the optimized components for media.
2. Regularly check for unused dependencies and code.
3. Monitor performance metrics in production.
4. Test performance impact of new features before deployment.
