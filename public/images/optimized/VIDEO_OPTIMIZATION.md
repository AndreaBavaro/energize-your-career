# Video Optimization Strategy

The original video file (helpingvid.mp4) is approximately 10MB, which is too large for optimal web performance.

## Recommended Optimization Steps:

1. **Use a Video Compression Tool**:
   - Compress the video to reduce file size by 70-80%
   - Recommended tools: Handbrake, FFmpeg, or online services like Cloudinary

2. **Create Multiple Formats**:
   - Create WebM version for modern browsers (typically 30-40% smaller than MP4)
   - Keep MP4 as fallback for older browsers

3. **Implementation in Code**:
   - The HTML has been updated to use the optimized video paths
   - Lazy loading has been implemented
   - Video preload is set to "none" to prevent automatic downloading

## Manual Steps to Optimize:

1. Compress the original video to MP4:
   - Target size: 2-3MB (70-80% reduction)
   - Resolution: 1280px width (height proportional)
   - Save as: "/public/images/optimized/helpingvid.mp4"

2. Create WebM version:
   - Target size: 1-2MB
   - Same resolution as MP4
   - Save as: "/public/images/optimized/helpingvid.webm"

These optimizations will significantly reduce page load time and bandwidth usage.
